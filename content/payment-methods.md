Integrating with Truust offers your customers many different ways to pay – and we’re always working on adding more. Here's a quick list of what we currently offer, and whom they are available to.

## Cards

### 3DS

### Non-secure Payments

To mitigate transaction dispute events, Truust demands a Deposit against risks. The amount is calculated based on company risk perception, the average amount of payouts and volume of transactions. Based on those parameters, Truust can demand additional funds for your deposit. You will be communicated about these needs. In case you miss the period of deposit, payouts are blocked. Once the deposit is made, payouts are normalised.

### Card Tokenization

### Chargebacks

Fraudulent activities can happen to any business, and it is your responsibility to know who you should do business with. Chargebacks are the term that explains when there is a lost dispute about a transaction. We charge a standard fee in the event of a chargeback.
